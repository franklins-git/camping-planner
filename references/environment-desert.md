# Environment Variant: Desert

Load this file for hot, dry, high-exposure locations (for example: Mojave, Sonoran, Big Bend lowlands).

## Primary Risk Pattern

- Heat stress and dehydration
- Large day/night temperature swings
- Sparse shade and long exposed travel
- Limited reliable water
- Flash-flood potential in washes and canyons

## Planning Adjustments

- Shift strenuous activity to early morning.
- Add a midday heat-avoidance block.
- Increase water carry and electrolyte planning.
- Add sun-protective clothing and shade strategy.
- Add explicit turnaround times tied to temperature.

## Gear Emphasis

- Sun shirt, wide-brim hat, sunglasses
- High-volume water carry plus contingency reserve
- Electrolyte mix
- Cooling towel or shade tarp
- Night insulation for temperature drop

## No-Go Triggers

- Forecast highs beyond group heat tolerance
- Water source uncertainty without backup
- Thunderstorm risk in narrow drainages
- New or unmanaged heat-related symptoms

## Communication Notes

- Warn about weak cellular coverage.
- Recommend offline maps and printed fallback.
- Set strict check-in windows because travel is slower in heat.
