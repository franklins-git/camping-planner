# Meal Planning Guidance

## Planning Principles

- Prefer simple meals with low failure risk.
- Match meals to cooking method and cleanup limits.
- Add no-cook backup options for weather or fatigue.

## Meal Framework by Trip Length

- 1 night: 1 dinner, 1 breakfast, trail snacks
- 2 nights: 2 dinners, 2 breakfasts, 2 lunches, snacks
- 3+ nights: repeatable meal blocks and one backup meal per day

## Beginner-Safe Meal Pattern

- Breakfast: quick hot meal (oats, eggs, wraps)
- Lunch: no-cook or minimal-cook (sandwiches, wraps, fruit)
- Dinner: one-pot meals (pasta, rice bowls, chili)
- Snacks: high-energy, low-mess items

## Food Safety and Storage

- Keep perishables cold and separated from raw proteins.
- Follow local wildlife food-storage practices.
- Minimize leftovers unless storage is reliable.
- Plan cleanup water and biodegradable soap usage where permitted.

## Water Planning

Provide a per-day estimate based on climate and activity.
Include a reserve margin and at least one treatment/backup method when source certainty is low.

## Constraints Handling

When dietary needs exist, replace meals rather than adding extra complexity.
Prefer shared-base meals with optional add-ons for group compatibility.
