# Itinerary Patterns

## Core Scheduling Rules

- Keep first day light: arrival, setup, orientation.
- Place highest-effort activity on best-weather window.
- Keep daily buffer for delays and rest.
- Set a turnaround time for hikes.
- Reserve final block for cleanup and departure checks.

## 1-Night Pattern

- Day 1: Arrive, setup, short activity, dinner, quiet hours
- Day 2: Breakfast, short walk/viewpoint, pack out, depart

## 2-Night Pattern

- Day 1: Arrival and setup only
- Day 2: Primary activity day + backup indoor/short option
- Day 3: Easy morning, cleanup, departure

## 3+ Night Pattern

- Day 1: Arrival/setup
- Day 2: Exploration A
- Day 3: Recovery or low-effort day
- Day 4+: Exploration B or weather-shifted plans
- Final day: pack out and contingency time

## Family and Beginner Modifiers

- Shorten activity blocks.
- Add snack/water breaks every 60-90 minutes.
- Keep an always-available "return to camp" option.
