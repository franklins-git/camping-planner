# Environment Variant: Coastal

Load this file for coastlines, marine terraces, and shore-adjacent camp zones.

## Primary Risk Pattern

- Wind exposure and rapid fog changes
- Damp conditions and chill from marine air
- Tide and surf hazards near shore routes
- Corrosion/sand impact on gear and cooking setup
- Limited shelter from wind at open sites

## Planning Adjustments

- Anchor camp setup for wind and gusts.
- Place exposed activities in calmer forecast windows.
- Add tide-aware timing for shoreline walks.
- Keep warm layers accessible during daytime.
- Add weather-flex backup plans for fog or wind.

## Gear Emphasis

- Wind-resistant shell layers
- Extra dry storage and clothing protection
- Secure staking and guy-line setup
- Warm sleep setup for damp nights
- Lighting and visibility aids for fog conditions

## No-Go Triggers

- High-surf or coastal hazard advisories
- Sustained wind beyond tent/site tolerance
- Tide windows that trap shoreline routes
- Persistent wet+cold combination without dry backup clothes

## Communication Notes

- Verify local advisories and tide charts from official sources.
- Set conservative route turnarounds around headlands and beaches.
- Include a dry-gear contingency for multi-day trips.
