# Safety Baseline

## Core Rule

Give conservative guidance first. Optimize comfort or fun only after safety is covered.

## Hazard Review Template

| Hazard Area | Baseline Controls | Escalation Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weather | Check forecast range, pack layered clothing, rain plan | Storm warnings, extreme heat/cold |
| Wildlife | Store food and scented items correctly, keep clean camp | Frequent sightings, food-conditioned wildlife |
| Terrain | Choose easy routes, set turnaround time, carry map | Loose terrain, creek crossings, cliff exposure |
| Water | Confirm source availability, carry reserve, purify unknown water | Source uncertainty, high heat, long trail time |
| Fire | Check current restrictions, stove backup, extinguish fully | Windy conditions, burn bans, dry fuels |
| Health | First-aid kit, personal meds, hydration plan | Symptoms of heat illness, altitude illness, allergic reaction |

## Minimum Safety Content in Every Plan

- Nearest ranger/visitor information path to verify rules
- Communication plan (cell, offline map, paper backup)
- Emergency contacts and check-in windows
- Evacuation trigger points (weather, injury, fatigue, gear failure)
- Nighttime temperature readiness check

## No-Go Conditions

Recommend postponing or changing plan when any of these apply:
- Severe weather alerts during planned outdoor windows
- Inadequate insulation or shelter for forecast lows
- No reliable water plan
- Group health constraints not accommodated
- Required permits or access status unknown near departure

## Environment Routing

Load a single environment variant when relevant:
- Desert: `references/environment-desert.md`
- Alpine/high-elevation: `references/environment-alpine.md`
- Coastal: `references/environment-coastal.md`

## Location Rule Handling

Never guess local restrictions. If uncertain, state:
- Which rule is unknown
- Why it affects the plan
- What official source the user must verify before departure
