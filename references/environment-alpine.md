# Environment Variant: Alpine

Load this file for high-elevation or mountain terrain with rapid weather shifts.

## Primary Risk Pattern

- Altitude stress and reduced exertion tolerance
- Fast weather changes (wind, storms, cold)
- Cold nights even in warm seasons
- Steep terrain and footing hazards
- Snow patches or shoulder-season ice

## Planning Adjustments

- Reduce daily mileage and elevation gain for beginners.
- Include acclimatization time when elevation is high.
- Build earlier turnaround times for afternoon weather.
- Add layered-clothing checks at start and mid-day.
- Add low-exposure backup activities near camp.

## Gear Emphasis

- Warm insulating layer plus shell
- Dry sleep clothes and extra socks
- Trekking poles for stability
- Map and route cues for low-visibility conditions
- Headlamp plus battery reserve

## No-Go Triggers

- Thunderstorm timing in exposed terrain windows
- Inadequate insulation for overnight lows
- Altitude illness symptoms that worsen with rest
- Route hazards beyond group ability

## Communication Notes

- Assume spotty coverage and delayed response time.
- Set hard retreat rules for weather, fatigue, and daylight.
- Include nearest lower-elevation fallback area.
