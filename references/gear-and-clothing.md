## Clothing System

Use layered clothing:
- Base layer: moisture management
- Mid layer: insulation
- Outer layer: wind/rain protection
- Sleep layer: dry reserve for night

Pack one extra warm layer beyond daytime expectations.

## Seasonal Modifiers

- Cold shoulder seasons: add insulated jacket, warmer sleep system, gloves/beanie
- Wet climates: prioritize waterproof shell, extra socks, tarp/rain setup
- Hot and exposed climates: sun shirt, hat, electrolyte plan, larger water carry

## Budget Prioritization

Buy/rent in this order:
1. Sleep warmth and shelter reliability
2. Water safety and lighting
3. Cooking and comfort upgrades

If budget is tight, provide:
- Must-have now
- Can borrow/rent
- Nice-to-have later
